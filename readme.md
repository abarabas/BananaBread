# BandHunter

## Introdution

This has been a proyect for the Google Developer Bus 2013 Argentina edition.
It's been 3 days of hard work with an amaizing group of 4 people. All this
code has been programmed by the owner of the repository (abarabas) an the
collaborator ngleich but it couldn't have been done without the help of
@ricardocorbetta and Lucia.

So thank you very much for the amazing experience we've lived in this 3 days.
I personally could not have found a better group than you guys. Thanks.

## Description

BandHunter was made for the music bands, the public and the media. It's a
place where you can find every bit of information about emerging bands and
shows near you. Being the owner of a band has never been easier with the
tools this proyect provides. And all this could make a hell of an analytics
program for the media.

## Technologies

  * CodeIgniter as the framework base.
  * YouTube Data API for search, user activity and videos.
  * Google Maps API for geolocalization.
  * SoundCloud API to fetch the bands' music.
  * data.buenosaires.gob.ar as a resource of local shows.
